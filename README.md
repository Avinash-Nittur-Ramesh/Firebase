1. Create a Sign-in method in Authentication.
2. Obtain UID from users in authentication.
3. Obtain firebase config information from Project Settings.
4. Create a project directory in local disk.
5. Initialize firebase using 'firebase init'.
6. Create all the required javascript files and a single page index.html file in public folder.
7. Login to firebase services using 'firebase login'.
8. Modify the access rules in the corresponding JSON files. For Cloud storage, additionally run the CORS script to allow access from a specific endpoint.
10. Deploy firebase application locally using 'firebase serve'.
11. Deploy firebase application in the assigned Firebase server location using 'firebase deploy'.
